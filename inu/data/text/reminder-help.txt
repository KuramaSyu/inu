I accept stuff like:
 
 **Fist some examples:**
- `1min 3s 40y 4h`
- `4:00pm 32s 1 day`
- `16:00`
- `2022-12-31`

**Now in detail:**
- relative time stuff like 3min
-> I know nearly every unit and it's short form e.g. (second, sec, s; minute, min, m)..
- time in form of `HH:MM`
-> You can use 24h format or 12 format am/pm
- dates in form of `yyyy-mm-dd or yyyy/mm/dd`
