  **What is a tag?**
  You can think of it like a song.
  If you want to hear a song, you search for it's name,
  to get the actual song.
  So where is the tag different?
  Instead of the actual song, think of a big text.
  You can't remember this big text.
  So you give this text a title or a shortcut.
  This title or shortcut is the _name_.
  and always when you do /tag get <name>
  you will get the big text, behind the name/title/shortcut.
  The big text is by the way called _value_.
