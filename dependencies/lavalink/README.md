# What is this folder for?
## the `fredboat/lavalink:dev` image will be used when starting the bot with docker.
## the `application.yml` file is needed for setup (copy yours into this folder)
## when starting the bot on your machine (with python instead of docker), this folder wont be needed. In this case the `music` folder will be needed
